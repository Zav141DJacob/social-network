To install the required modules to start the application you need to:

2) `npm install`

    wait a minute or two

3) `npm start`

    open a new terminal 
    and move into 
    the real-time-forum
    directory

4) `go run .`

And thats about it!

The backend is hosted on 

http://localhost:8000 

and the frontend is hosted on

http://localhost:3000               <---- the main forum application
